Welcome to Huanhuan Ma (Andy)'s Personal Homepage!

I am a master student at the [Institute of Automation, Chinese Academy of Sciences](http://english.ia.cas.cn/) (expected to graduate in June 2024). Additionally, I am a member at the [Center for Research on Intelligent Perception and Computing (CRIPAC)](http://cripac.ia.ac.cn/en/EN/volumn/home.shtml), National Laboratory of Pattern Recognition (NLPR). I am fortunate to be advised by [Qiang Liu](https://john-qiangliu.tech/) and [Liang Wang](http://www.cbsr.ia.ac.cn/users/liangwang/).

My research interests lie in the field of natural language processing (NLP), with a focus on fake information detection, including fact verification and out-of-context detection. Currently, I am highly intrigued by exploring the intersection of Large Language Models (LLMs) and AI safety.

I have spent wonderful time at [BAAI](https://www.baai.ac.cn/english.html), and [NC State](https://dongkuanx27.github.io/page-lab.html) as a research intern/assistant.
